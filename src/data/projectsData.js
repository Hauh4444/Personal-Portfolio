        overview: "A professional Windows desktop application born from identifying real operational gaps while working as an inventory counter at WIS International. Despite being in a non-technical counting role, I consistently worked closely with managers and assisted teams during the inventory process. Together, we identified critical limitations in available tools, managers lacked access to individual employee accuracy metrics, team statistics by zone, and clear service miscount visibility. I leveraged my software engineering skills to build this solution, which now actively supports day-to-day operations and management decision-making.",
        context: "Created while working as an inventory counter who demonstrated exceptional performance, leading to close collaboration with management. Recognized operational inefficiencies and missing analytics that managers needed but couldn't access. Built this tool to solve real business problems, providing the visibility and metrics that improve operational efficiency and team performance.",
